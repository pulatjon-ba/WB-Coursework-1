The link to the website: https://yellow-tallia-28.tiiny.site

The project is basically done for a company I work for. I didn't add full information about the company, but briefly, and clear. I have used HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I validated HTML and CSS as said in the coursework description. Coming to the website itself, when a user enters the website, s/he faces the home page where there can be found some information about the company and structure of the website. Then About Us page, where I wrote some facts and stats about the company. I also included services the company can provide for clients, with a faqs section in the bottom part. Clients can know about the leaders of the company from the team page, where the main figures are mentioned and quoted. If in case the client has questions, they can head over to the Contact Us page and send a request via email. Btw, I validated the form through JS, so the information the user enters is valid. It is very simple and user-friendly web page. The website can work on any device since I used responsive design. I tried to make pages as creative as I can, but for now, these are all. Thank you.
